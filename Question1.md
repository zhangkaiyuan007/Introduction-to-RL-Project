# Question 1: 
In 50-75 words, detail what happens when you run this code and explain why the pole falls so quickly.
- When I run this code, a pygame window pop out. A pole in the cart falls to either right or left.
- The reason is we set a random action to the pole which is a random force in such condition. It can be estimated that without controlling the force based on the real-time situation, the pole will definitely fall.
